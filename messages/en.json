"About": {
  "title": "Why Super Waiter?",
   "intro": "To run the Super Waiter system, you don't need any special devices - a regular computer or laptop is enough. This significantly reduces costs. At the same time, you can connect as many printers as you want and fully integrate them with the system.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Unify all your systems on one platform",
      "desc": "Super Waiter combines your restaurant, café, or fast-food operations into one unified management system. Orders, staff, receipt printing, and accounting — all in one place."
    },
    {
      "title": "2 apps – one system",
      "desc": "After installing SO, you get two apps: one for waiters to receive orders, and another for admins to manage and analyze operations. Both work on computers and mobile devices."
    },
    {
      "title": "Track reports and sales from anywhere",
      "desc": "The admin panel is cloud-based, allowing access from anywhere with an internet connection. Daily sales, warehouse, staff, and customer reports are always available."
    },
    {
      "title": "Easy setup and automatic updates",
      "desc": "Installing SO takes just a few minutes. Updates are delivered automatically, with no manual configuration required."
    },
    {
  "title": "Full Warehouse Control",
  "desc": "The SO warehouse module automatically tracks all product movements. As each dish is prepared, used ingredients are deducted automatically, the remaining stock is displayed accurately, and the system notifies you when supplies are running low."
},

You can customize the layout, change the style, edit text formats, and add your restaurant or café logo for a beautifully branded receipt.
